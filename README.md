# Reddit Votes Bot

*Reacts to YOUR messages with only the most powerful of upvotes. And downvotes. Downvotes too.*

## How to use

Step 1:

Make an [application][discord_dev] and copy the token of your bot to your clipboard. Then, [download master.zip][master] and unzip.

Step 2:

Install Python and [discord.py][discordpy] (as stated in the requirements section) with a package manager like [pip][pip], then update the [setup.py][settings] with your token you copied as well as your prefix of choice and (optional) user ID.

Step 3:

Invite the bot to a server of your choice and add two emojis with the names "upvote" and "downvote". You can get the image files for these in the [images folder][images]. Copy that server's ID and add it to [setup.py][settings] where it says "serverid".

Step 4:

Open a command-line, go to the directory with the `bot.py`, and run `python3 bot.py` (`python bot.py` for Windows users). Enjoy~!

You don't have to give credit to me. That's not what Github is for (in my opinion).
